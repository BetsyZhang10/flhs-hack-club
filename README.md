# Francis Lewis High School Hack Club
The new website for the flhs hack club! Our original website was at https://flhs-hacks.flhshacks.repl.co.

This website is being hosted on Vercel for faster deployment.

Because this repository is unfinished, you may experience some bugs when using the website.

Please be patient as we finish setting everything up.

You should experience changes over the month of Febuary. If you believe you spotted a bug, please report it here using a pull request or contact @BetsyZhang10, the owner.
