<p>Hi coder, youâ€™ve stumbled across the Hack Club @ FLHS, <strong> a chapter of the international non-profit organization Hack Club</strong>! This is a club for everyone- from beginners to experts. We meet every Tuesday from 3-4:30PM EST to work on projects, learn more about coding, and hang out and make new friends! By the end of the first week, you would have coded your own personal website. By the end of the first month, you would have learned how to code a Sound Galaxy. Anyone from grades 9-12 is welcome! Oh, and you get free stickers as well! <br>
